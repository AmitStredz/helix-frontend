## üöÄ Project Overview

**Helix** is an AI agentic DeFi trading platform built for the BNB Smart Chain. Helix empowers users to:
- Connect their EVM wallets (MetaMask)
- Initialize secure, agent-managed vaults for trading
- Let AI agents trade on their behalf, or receive real-time trading suggestions
- Add custom trading strategies for the agent to execute
- Monitor real-time vault balances, transaction history, and agent performance

### Real-World Scenarios & Market Problems

#### ‚ùå **Current Problems in DeFi Trading**
- Manual trading is time-consuming and error-prone
- Most users lack the expertise to build and execute complex strategies
- Bots and automation are inaccessible to non-coders
- Market volatility and 24/7 trading make it hard to keep up
- Security and custody risks with third-party bots

#### ‚úÖ **Helix Solution**
- **AI Agentic Automation**: Users initialize a vault, and an AI agent takes over trading, optimizing for yield and risk
- **Custom Strategies**: Users can input their own strategies, which the agent will follow
- **Hybrid Control**: Users can let the agent trade fully autonomously, or receive agent suggestions and execute trades themselves
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: All trades, balances, and agent actions are visible in real time
- **Secure Vaults**: Funds are held in user-specific smart contract vaults, not by the platform
- **No Coding Required**: Anyone can leverage advanced trading automation without writing code

### Typical User Flow
1. **Connect Wallet**: User connects MetaMask (any EVM chain)
2. **Initialize Vault**: User creates a secure vault (secondary address) for agentic trading
3. **Deposit Funds**: User receives funds into the vault (via QR or address)
4. **Agent Takes Over**: AI agent starts trading based on default or user-supplied strategies
5. **User Interaction**: User can monitor, withdraw, or override agent with manual trades or new strategies
6. **Transparency**: All actions, trades, and balances are visible in the dashboard
